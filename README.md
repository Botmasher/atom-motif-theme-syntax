# Motif Syntax Theme Demo

This package demonstrates a simple theme for restyling Atom's syntax/editor area. It follows the steps in the Creating Theme section of chapter 3 in the Atom Flight Manual.

To test this package in your local Atom install, save the contents in a directory inside your .atom/packages, which is located either off of user home or as a sibling to the application if you're running Atom in portable mode.
